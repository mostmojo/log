### Day 1: Saturday, 4th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Key CSS grid terms: `container, row, column, area, items, cells, display: grid`.

‚Ä¢ Downloaded new Mozilla Firefox and checked out grids in dev tools w/ line numbers.

‚Ä¢ Practiced moving grids around on codepen with `grid-row` & `grid-column` syntax.

### Day 2: Sunday, 5th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Continued learning CSS grid - infinite `col` span using -1.

‚Ä¢ Name grid lines: ex. `grid-template-rows: [ header-start ] 100px [ header-end box-start ] 200px [ box-end main-start ] 400px [ main-end footer-start ] 100px [ footer-end ];`.

‚Ä¢ Functionality of cols using `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, [ col-start ] 1fr [ col-end ]) 200px [ grid-end ]; &rarr; col-start-1 col-end-1, col-start-2 col-end-2`, etc.

### Day 3: Monday, 6th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ More on CSS grids. New elements: `grid-auto-rows` for `implicit` grids w/ keyword `dense` to avoid 'holes'.

‚Ä¢ Elements similar to flexbox: `justify-items` and `align-items` (and self) for X & Y axis alignment. Also, `max-content` and `min-content` for responsive layouts w/ `auto-fit`/ `auto-fill`.

‚Ä¢ Started NEXTER project by Jonas Schmedtmann to put all grid-work into practice. To remember: `grid-template-columns:
    [sidebar-start] 8rem [sidebar-end full-start] 1fr [center-start] repeat(8, [col-start] minmax(min-content, 14rem) [col-end]
    )[center-end] 1fr [full-end];` &rarr; All naming, numeric and minmax functions utilized in one place ü§ì.

### Day 4: Tuesday, 7th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Dissected Craft CMS / PHP Twig site. Familiarized myself with Twig syntax, ternary operators and framework. Content blocks within matrix fields can be selected. For loops with array indices can display images; with transform props! Remember: `{% set variable = entry.title %}` for logic vs `<p>{{ entry.title }}</p>` for display. 

‚Ä¢ Looked into yarn builds, compilers, SASS variables, the asset pipeline and began to break down Twig logic. 

‚Ä¢ Worked on layout of Nexter project. Used `line names` within `grid-column` property in practice to align sections. Ex. `grid-column: col-start 7 / full-end;`

### Day 5: Wednesday, 8th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Twig - base inheritance w/ `{% extends '_base' %}` `{% block content %} {% endblock %}`. Used global handles: `@assetUrl, {{ entry.url }}, {{ url( '/.../ ~ entry.slug' ) }}, {{ siteUrl }}` to display different url scenarios. 

‚Ä¢ JS `cloak` library, `% placeholder selectors` in SASS - `@extends` , `itemscope` using schema.org, `vendor` files and Craft CMS globals: `getPrev, orderBy, postDate, {% include x %}`, `paginated` entries and `craft.app.request`. `Invisible` classes  to keep semantic structure: h1 > h2 > h3, etc. Also - `loop.last` & `|raw` filter for escaping in Twig.

‚Ä¢ Continued on nexter project - **features** layout with CSS grids within `grid items`. Added svg files with `use xlink:href` and `sprite` files.

### Day 6: Thursday, 9th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Researched `breadcrumbs` for general UI/UX design - extra navigation. Studied *graceful degredation* vs *progressive enhancement* for JS & non JS browsers.  

‚Ä¢ Continued exploring SASS `$variables`, reusable components and utilities; `@extend` with `%` selectors. Looked into the power of `display: inline-block` vs `block`

‚Ä¢ Deciphered variables in `twig` syntax with k:v pairs with arrays which hold social icon data (handles, urls, icon font, aria labels) to render them in HTML. Ex.`{% for class, content in footer_social if content[1] %}
<a href="{{ content[1] }}" class="a icon icon--{{ class }}" aria-label="{{ content[0] }}"></a>
{% endfor %}`

### Day 7: Friday, 10th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Looked into JavaScript `(function() document.body.className += ' js')` to grab contents of the body in a document that contain JS and render them into `script` tags.

‚Ä¢ Twig logic with additional conditions for displaying contents within a footer of a Craft CMS-based site. Remember: `{% set casting_case = '' %}` syntax for loops - `objects` and `arrays` came handy with navbar segments.

‚Ä¢ Created `/casting` section, fields, design layout, entries in Craft for new Studio Ramsay page. Made button component in asset pipepline and ensured responsiveness. First deployment w/ `jupiter` - AWS & docker!

### Day 8: Saturday, 11th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Continued Nexter project. Used auto-fit property on parent grid element with minmax to fit contents of the col-grid according to minimum width and 1fr. Anything < 250px would decreased the cols from 3 to 2 to 1, etc. using auto-fit. `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(25rem, 1fr));`

‚Ä¢ Used `grid-template-columns: min-content 1fr;` on child grid to create cols based on content and adapt. Remember: `fill` property is used to define colors on `svg` icons.

‚Ä¢ Made `%heading` placeholder selector for typography and `@extend` into relevant headings throughout project.

### Day 10: Monday, 13th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Looked into Eric Meyer's Reset CSS stylesheet to reduce browser inconsistencies. Read Twig docs to see how `|length` filter operates.

‚Ä¢ Further dive into more complex conditionals in twig to display images with image transforms (Craft CMS), reverse--rows, helper tags for margins, typeset classes to style dynamic content and research `display: inline, block, inline-block`.

‚Ä¢ Started the house section of Nexter w/ `<use xlink:href="img/sprite.svg#icon-heart-full"></use>` SVGs, multi-nested classes and grid-items.

### Day 11: Tuesday, 14th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Looked into NkdTV layout, craft setup to identify sections, fields, handles, entry types. Looked into image magick error with yarn dependencies, docker config files and node modules. *Tip:* don't `yarn install`, but `yarn build:js` otherwise it overwrites everything you've pasted from older files! 

‚Ä¢ Analysed a nav item variable declaration, for loop with 2 parameters and more complex logic to display relevant nav items with highlighting styles upon selection using ternary operators. *Tip:* remember the mighty `.env` file when configuring the DB!

‚Ä¢ Finished home card section on Nexter project using CSS grids and flexbox. Used `transform: translateY(50%);` for positioning and `z-index` with `align-self: end` to place an svg file with grid system.

### Day 12: Wednesday, 15th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Studied Craft's `category groups`, `field layouts` and relationships using `source` to identify a for loop that renders content to the browser using a 'work role' category, filtered by 'departments'.  

‚Ä¢ Learned about the kanban process, component delegation when working in groups, and maintainable code structure.

‚Ä¢ Started a gallery section in Nexter with another grid featuring gallery items, `object-fit: cover` property and `display: block` to prevent whitespace created by inline elements that behave like text.

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Create a new section for client to showcase new `shows`. Ensure all fields and design layout in the CMS was sufficient and had good instructions for client. 

‚Ä¢ Relate content by `category groups` to display project status using Craft CMS. Indentation, variable naming and continuity is key. Brief look at `JS polyfills` for IE8 browser knowledge.

‚Ä¢ Imitate design & structure from related section and InVision mockup. Got a small taste of `kanban` agile methodology. Made relevant index and entry files in asset pipeline.

### Day 18: Tuesday, 21st May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Ternary operators in twig to select specific classes for a `header--transparent` vs `header--primary` class. E.g. `{{ site_area == '' ? ' header--transparent' : ' header--primary' }}`. Also, intermediate responsive queries for mobile layout including font & image sizing as per different setting. 

‚Ä¢ `style="background-image: url( 'image.getUrl( 'imageTransformName' )' )";` for more stretchable images with transforms for better performance, with hidden `img src` & `position: absolute; top: -999;` values present to contain ARIA & accessibility labels. 

‚Ä¢ Basic run-through of `bash` scripts that configure and prompt `nginx, docker, CraftCMS, Jupiter & Saturn` deployment / setup. Study `main & final.js` files with relevant scripts for pips & slideshows.

### Day 27: Thursday, 30th May, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Read hubspot docs to integrate form with JavaScript `createElement`, `innerHTML`, `getElementById` and `appendChild` selectors. Use HS-based classes to style sheet accordingly. 

‚Ä¢ Study `matrices` in craft and render them in `Twig`. Use `{% include x %}` to define `hashes` with `key:value` pairs using the `with` param for `_partials.twig`. Look into inline styling `background-image: url("{{ image[0].getUrl(passImageTransformHere )}}")` for this occassion only as it applies the image transforms with `getUrl()`. Tip: `.url` would render the image *without* the transforms!  

‚Ä¢ Finish first iteration of for-fun personal site using latest Adv. CSS course projects and styling.

‚Ä¢ Build `macros` in `Twig` and their functionality for images, social links and slider transforms. E.g.  `{% macro macroName(parameter1, parameter2) %}` - similar to JS functions, with `for loops` and `hashes`.

‚Ä¢ Jonas course final restaurant challenge w/ data structures, objects, logical operators, loops and literals without solution. Tip: in JS we can utilize the `[i]` variable declared in the loop as a placeholder for iteration. Use `this.bill = something` or `this.bill[i]` to refer to variable/value.

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Look into operator precedence on MDN docs to understand order that JS reads specific expressions and logical operators. Comes handy when using ex. `this.someArray.length;`.

‚Ä¢ Review tip calculator challenge (pt.1) in Jonas' course. Understand use of `this` in JavaScript, the `i` counter variable and its usability.

‚Ä¢ Start pt.2 - Apply similar functionality of `obj1` to `obj2` and think of average calculator `function` to apply to both objects.

### Day 30: Sunday, 2nd June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Complete JS tip calculator challenge. Add reusable `function calcAverage(tips) { ... }` that takes ex. `john.tips` & `mark.tips` argument and can be used multiple times while staying DRY. Declare `var sum = 0` outside the loop so value doesn't reset once function is complete. Then `+=` tip values into the variable `sum` and `/ tips.length` to get average.

‚Ä¢ Brief intro to `ES5` vs `ES6` syntax, purpose of comp/transpilers ex. `babel` and pros & cons of knowing both syntaxes. 

‚Ä¢ Theory - code execution: `parser` &rarr; abstract `syntax tree` &rarr; conversion to machine code &rarr; code runs. Learn theory on `hoisting` - identify between `function declarations` (don't need to be declared before use) and `variable declarations` (Need to be declared before use). Also, learn about `global execution context` vs `functional execution context`. Ex. if `var age = 23;` is declared in global context, then also identical variable within a function, it'll render as their execution context differs ü§ì.

### Day 31: Monday, 3rd June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Reuseable `typeset` extensions w/ `.h-1, %heading-style-4 { ...; }` later `@extend` elsewhere. Study `getPrev()` & `getNext()` Craft methods, and the `{%- whitespace controller -%}`. Plus, `|trim('https://', 'left')` twig filter for trimming content.

‚Ä¢ Use `<figure>` & `<figcaption>` semantic HTML tags for img + video content and look at video tag with `muted loop autoplay` attributes. Also, the `<blockquote>` accompanied by `<cite>` to be used with `<figure>` for quotes.

‚Ä¢ `flex-wrap: wrap` vs `nowrap;` in flexbox, `word-break: break;` properties; the `rel="noopener"` attribute in `<a>` tags to prevent JS in site via global `.window` opening it for *a)* general performance benefits *b)* security benefits - malicious redirect prevention.

‚Ä¢ Playground with `display: flex` in codepen to practice `flex items`, `columns`, `directions` and `wrap`. Finish JS Theory on local and global `scope`, `scoping chain` and `context`.

### Day 32: Tuesday, 4th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Trace back an error with `twitterUrl()` not recognized. Suggested: `importdb` in terminal or backup db from craft. Then drag/drop into `SequelPro` and distinguish between local testing and staging environments. 

‚Ä¢ Study relational `field types` in Twig which work the same as `sections` & `channels` when queried.  ex. `{% for project in craft.entries('projects') %}` vs reverse relations using `.relatedTo()` - this avoids data duplication. ex. `{% set relatedProjects = craft.entries.section('projects').relatedTo(entry) %}` where `entry` is the *service* entry (the one we want to relate to). 

‚Ä¢ Create a landing page for practice from `sketch`, using `flexbox`. Tip: use `flex: 1;` for spacing, and keep elements in divs that need to be flexed. Can also change `flex-direction: column;` for mobile responsiveness. `@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {...}`. Finish by looking into twitter card meta data with image dimensions and relevant `og:titles`.

‚Ä¢ **Tip:** Add linear gradient to background, then `clip` the text and make the `fill` transparent to get a nice `bg gradient` inside the font - pure gold. `.class { background: linear-gradient(to right, #494964, #6f6f89); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
-webkit-background-clip: text;`

### Day 33: Wednesday, 5th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Create a url path using function `url('contact', { contact: entry.project[0].firstName })` to return `site.com/contact?contact=bob` - domain, path, query string hash

‚Ä¢ Study `{% include x %}` components and what `key: value` pairs are passed and how they are used in `Twig`. Research `flex-shrink: 0;` for when flex items exceed container limit. 

‚Ä¢ Make small tip calculator with `gradient`, `clip`, `webkit-fill`, the `transform: translateY` property and `calcTip()` JS function paired with `calcAverage()` (CRUD) for two fictional objects.

### Day 34: Thursday, 6th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Built tip calculator with HTML, CSS & JS that rendered `calcTip()` and `calcAverage()` functions to the console in the DOM. Ensured syntactically to complete the challenge in both `ES5` and `ES6` declaring `key:values` with `this` keyword where appropriate.

‚Ä¢ Study `functional` scope vs `class/variable` scope and how functions are read and hoisted depending on where they are invoked.

‚Ä¢ Use `animate.css` library to create `zoomIn` & `zoomOut`-type effects in CSS for specific elements. Ensure semantic HTML tags such as `<section>` and `<figure>` were integrated. Once complete, rendered final restaurant bills in the `DOM`.

### Day 35: Friday, 7th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Refactored folder architecture of calculator project with `@import url(folder/file`) in `style.css` and added comments.

‚Ä¢ Built bear cartoon from scratch using pure HTML `divs` and `css`. Utilize the power of subtleties like `position: absolute` and `border-radius: 100%;`. The use of `border-bottom: 2px solid #000;` property combined with `border-radius: 0% 0% 100% 100%;` to create half-moon shaped elements for a `mouth` was fun to figure out. Use `z-index` to bring elements on top of others. 

‚Ä¢ Read blog on `accessibility` and learn not to use `a:focus { outline: none; }` as users that navigate using keyboard-only wouldn't able to get there. Best practice: `a:focus { background-color: #000000; color: #FFFFFF; }` - alternate 'hidden' styles.

### Day 36: Saturday, 8th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Read a detailed explanation of how to creating pure `CSS` images. Distinguishing components, divs, shapes and how the overall layout of each element looks like. 

‚Ä¢ Start build for DOM pig game. Implement `Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1` global function to generate random decimal, round it down to nearest whole and ensure it fulfils 6-number dice roll. 

‚Ä¢ Study `getters` vs `setters` with `document.querySelector("#current-" + activePlayer).textContent = dice;` example. Use `concatenation` with JS `type coercion` to set the value of a dice roll to a specific `id` in HTML. If applying HTML tags, use `.innerHTML` and tags in brackets. Ex. `document.querySelector("#current-" + activePlayer).innerHTML = "<em>" + dice + "</em>"`. To hide a CSS class w/ JS: `document.querySelector(".dice").style.display = "none";` (Method, property, value).

**Tip**: 1) Shortcut to open console: `cmd + alt + i` 2) this variable is only assigned a value when object calls a method.

### Day 37: Sunday, 9th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Revise `querySelectors` by creating fun example with `getter` vs `setter`. Use setter with declared variable to change content in HTML with `textContent`. Set italics `<em>` with `.innnerHTML`.

‚Ä¢ Set `.addEventListener` with two params: `(click, function() { // do something });` to change img `src` of dice roll to `diceDOM.src = "dice-" + dice + ".png";` and concatenate the class with variable value and suffix.

‚Ä¢ Use `.getElementById` to grab scores and change `textContent` to 0. Ex. `document.getElementById("scores").textContent = "0";`. **Remember:** `callback functions` only work when the function/method is called. In `e`.handlers they can also be `anonymous` and belong to the `addEventListener` function as the 2nd parameter - only in that scope.

### Day 38: Monday, 10th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Create koala component with several divs from scratch. Use `:root` to declare variables and use them with `background: var(--green);`

‚Ä¢ Use `linear-gradient` with `bg-clip` and `text-fill-color: transparent` for modern text styling. Make triangle for koala hair with `clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 0% 100%, 100% 100%);`. Build `@keyframes drop` element with states `0-50-100%` and use the `animation: text 1.625s ease 1.5s;` property to render the animation. 

‚Ä¢ JS course: Add dice roll to `roundScore`, add ternary: `activePlayer === 0 ? activePlayer = 1 : activePlayer = 0;` to switch players and reset `roundScore = 0` both in DOM and HTML. Use `.classList.toggle("active")` to toggle the `classList` between the class `player-0-panel` and `player-1-panel` and hide dice img with .`style.display = "none".` **Note:** it's important to remember the DOM and HTML. Get JS code to do things in both, as the user will see the interface, not the console.

### Day 39: Tuesday, 11th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Make elephant ui component from scratch using CSS. Use `animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.02, 0.01, 0.21, 1);` to create spiralling animation effect. Use `transform: translate(34px, 0)` to move animation blocks on X & Y axis. 

‚Ä¢ Read on delayed effects of `cubic bezier` and how to make `infinite` loops using `animation` property. Deep analysis of dice game to understand building blocks of `('.btn-click').addEventListener('click', function() {...})` and relationship between HTML and JS classes. Also, when to reset scores of game both in `DOM` and user interface with use of `classList.toggle('class)`.

‚Ä¢ Continue DOM game and add current score to global score w/ `scores[activePlayer] += roundScore`, update UI w/ `textContent` and check if player won the game then add "Winner!", remove dice with `.style.display = "none"` and add winner class with `.classList.add/remove`. Also, create reusable `function nextPlayer()` to stay DRY.

### Day 40: Wednesday, 12th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Read on svg use, ex. `<button class="btn-new"><svg class="x"><use xlink:href="sprite.svg#icon-circle-with-plus"></use></svg>New game</button>` and how to use icomoon icons with a `sprite.svg file` including `fill: red` props for styling.

‚Ä¢ Finish iteration of dice game. Refactor to stay `"DRY"` and create resuable functions `init()` & `nextPlayer()`. Add `state` variable `gamePlayer = true/false` to reset when winner is declared or game hasn't started. Use `document.querySelector(".player-0-panel").classList.remove/add("active");` in reset to ensure red dot is in the right player panel. Also, add idle function `.addEventListener("click", init);` initialized only on dice roll.

‚Ä¢ Declare global `var lastDice` to save instance of `var dice`, containing `Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1);` and create condition `if (dice === 6 && lastDice === 6)` then set memory & DOM `scores` to 0 and call `nextPlayer()` üé≤. Ensure `lastDice` is global or else data will be lost if declared in functional scope, once function ends.

### Day 41: Thursday, 13th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ JavaScript, dice rolling & accessing input data! üôåüèº Create `input fields` and grab data using `querySelector(".class").value` prop to populate different scores for the game chosen by user.

‚Ä¢ Implement two dice imgs and create slightly more complex conditions for fun. Ensure to hide/show both img vars and include both in conditions like ` if (dice1 !== 1 && dice2 !== 1);` & `document.getElementById("dice-1").style.display = "block/none";`

‚Ä¢ Start `treehouse` Fullstack JS route, take skills test and start challenges. Review - script tags, `document.write`, mongoDB terms, 1-to-many relations and peek through phaser.js gaming library. **Tip:** `git reset HEAD / git reset --hard` to undo in git!

### Day 42: Friday, 14th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Primitives (`null, undefined, boolean, number, string`) vs `Constructors`, their `instances` and the `prototype` chain. The way that `OOP` works, JS interactions and objects. 

‚Ä¢ Create constructor objects `Person` and `Pokemon` with related `instances`: John, Mark || Pikachu, Slowbro to experiment with shared `prototype` function `calculateAge()` and `calculateDamage()`. This helped instil understanding of `inheritance`, the parent `object Object` properties ex. `toString()`, `hasOwnProperty()`, etc and **Prototype chain**.

‚Ä¢ Use chrome dev tools to log instances and explore showcasing `Person prototype properties` (`__proto__:`) vs `object Object properties`

### Day 43: Saturday, 15th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Explore order of var declarations, `mutations`, passing `primitives` into functions to create a copy. Passing references of objects and mutating their values.

‚Ä¢ Make example of `callback function` with for loop, using `.push` to put values of a function within a function into an array var. Ex. `arrResult.push(fn(arr[i]));`

‚Ä¢ Build callback function to calculate max heart rate using 1) a generic function w/ a loop over an input array function `arrayCalc(arr, fn) { ... }`, give it a `fn` as input to calculate something based on each element of the array. `Ex. var rates = arrayCalc(ages, maxHeartRate)`, where `maxHeartRate` returns `Math.round(206.9 - (0.67 * element));` only if `ages are >= 18` and is also only called within the loop. Hence, callback successful ü§ì.

### Day 44: Sunday, 16th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Simple refresher on debugging via Treehouse course. Debug a few errors using the console. 

‚Ä¢ Study functions that return functions, w/ shorthand syntax, ex. `interviewQuestion('teacher')('Mark');` Immediately invoked function expressions (`IIFE`) - w/ `(function () {...})()` to trick parser that it's an expression and not a declaration. In this case, we create a `private` scope. 

‚Ä¢ Make `closure` function to understand the scope and memory storage. Inner `fn` always has access to vars & params of its outer function, even after outer `fn` has returned, so we can invoke a `fn` with all params.

### Day 45: Monday, 17th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Make question-based closure functions by wrapping the whole function in an `IIFE (function() {...})();`, thus make its scope private. That way if someone else were to use it, and he/she had a var called Question or n, it would not interfere.

‚Ä¢ Use `Question.prototype.displayQuestion = function() { .. }` to set object's `this props` to `new` instance of `Question`.  Use `parseInt` to convert ex. `"2"` to integer, not string &rarr; `2`. Finally, use `callbacks` within functions to call other functions to `keepScores`.

‚Ä¢ Start plan for budgety app. Make notes on `modules` regarding: `UI`, `Data` and `Controller`.

---

### Day 46: Tuesday, 18th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Read on `private` vs `publicly` accessible closures and how the `return` values to a `k:v` become a simple object, and thus can be accessed outside of the function scope, stil within the `(var someName = function()...)();` wrapper as it's immediately invoked at the end, hence the function is not assigned to the variable, but its returning value is. Magic! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

‚Ä¢ Create global `appController` module w/ params `(function(budgetCtrl, UICtrl) {})(budgetController, UIController)` to obtain access to `budgetController` and `UIController` modules. Use `document.addEventListener('keypress', function(event) {..}` to call `ctrlAddItem()` once 'Enter' key is hit. Also, create more scalable code in the `UIController` to add vars (`DOMStrings`) to classes and `return` them so they're accessible in `appController.` - Closures are the fundamentals of React/Vue and modular code ü§ØüöÄ

‚Ä¢ Make `appController.init()` function to start app outside modular scope. Brief look at `every` and `Promise` in JS to lead way into more `async`-based ES6 syntax, `.fetch`, `JSON.stringify`, `state` manipulation and `AJAX`. Finish off with read on web assembly - `binary format`, `compilation speeds` and high level prog. language benefits.

### Day 47: Wednesday, 19th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Make `data` object of objects to hold expenses and incomes of app. Use `ID = data.allItems[type][data.allItems[type].length - 1].id + 1;` to add incoming data to the end of the array and assign it an id. 

‚Ä¢ Create an `addItems()` public function to push new items into the UIController using `data.allItems[type].push(newItem);`. Use `querySelector` to grab elements, and set template html to them using `''` then `.replace` dummy values with dynamic values and `insertAdjacentHTML` and keyword `beforeend` to the UI.

‚Ä¢ Use the `Array.prototype.slice.call(fields);` which is the global constructor `Object` to array-ify the user input values, and then set their current.value to `""` to reset the field. By setting `fieldsArr[0].focus()` we return back to the wanted element.

### Day 48: Thursday, 20th June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Extract values from data object w/ `data.budget = data.totals.inc - data.totals.exp;` object syntax to create `calculateBudget` function for `budgetController` module. Also, micro-modularized function ex. `getBudget()` that only retrieved specific data. Simple, reusable functions. 

‚Ä¢ Create `displayBudget()` function to display `calculateBudget` from `budgetController` module to the `UIController` module. Ex. `document.querySelector(DOMStrings.budgetLabel).textContent = obj.budget;` and due to `obj param` being linked via `UICtrl.displayBudget(budget)` and power of closures, all 3 modules are linked with the global `appController`.

‚Ä¢ Use event delegation for event bubbling, the big `itemID = (event.target.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.id);` to access elements within the DOM tree **(DOM Traversing)**. Use global `event.target` to get the target. Then isolate values into separate variables using `.split()` method and prepare for deletion with `.map()` and `splice()` at `indexOf()` a specific array üëΩ.

### Day 49: Friday, 21st June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Major app functionality works! üöÄ - Learn how to connect field inputs to numbers using `parseInt(splitID[1]);` wrapper. Also, accessing `parentNodes` and `childNodes` to manipulate & `remove` data in the DOM. Ex. `document.getElementById('income').parentNode
    .removeChild(document.getElementById('income'));`. 

‚Ä¢ Build `Expense.prototype.calcPercentage = function(totalIncome) { ... }` & `Expense.prototype.getPercentage = function() { ... }` in the `parent Constructor` so enable functions to be accessed by `expense instances`. In budgetController: `data.allItems.exp.forEach(function(x) { x.calculatePercentage(); }`.

‚Ä¢ Use `forEach()` function for `nodeLists` instead of arrays. (Where all HTML elements are stored in the DOM as `nodes`). This way, a set up for the percentages is set in the `UIController` and displayed to the browser.

### Day 50: Saturday, 22nd June, 2019

**Today's Progress**

‚Ä¢ Focus on the tiny details ü§ó - The decimal display of the budget app elements. Use `Math.abs()` to get the absolute value of a number. Set the decimal values of the number to two with the **Number prototype** `toFixed(2)` ex. `1,200.00`.

‚Ä¢ Divide numbers into substrings using `substr()`, use array data structures to capture integers and decimals with `.length` and set right commas ex. `int = int.substr(0, int.length - 3) + ',' + int.substr(int.length - 3, 3);` to output `23,500.00`.
