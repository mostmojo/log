### Day 1 : Tuesday, 13th August, 2019

**Today's Progress**

• Develop a client's page where a straight line was needed from the design. Utilize `::before` & `::after` pseudo classes on a parent div to accurately portray the line. Lesson: Do not use pseudo classes on a parent `<img>` div as that's self closing and does not have pseudo classes!

• Learn about pulling dates from craft with `{{ entry.postDate | date("M d, Y") }}` and their various formats.

• Debugging broken code, especially with matrix blocks. If block is set to a specific section with a variable, always pull data with `variable_name.title` and not `block.title`.
