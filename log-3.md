### Day 1 : Sunday, 1st November, 2020

**Today's Progress**

•  Create flask app in python for client music recording studio app after watching a Flask Blog series (8 episodes thus far) of Corey Schafer on YouTube.

• Set up package with `if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(debug=True)`, `__init__.py`, `routes`, `templates` and `static files`

• Look into Jinja2 extends vs include terms for: `{% extends 'layout.html' %}` & `{% include 'partials/guitar_block.html' %}`

• Read on Python Anywhere deployment via Github and create account
